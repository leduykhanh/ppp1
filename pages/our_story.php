				<h3>You were a Patient?</h3>

				Sometime around September 2011, I had a huge acne outbreak over my forehead while I was working in the public hospital due to the long hours and stress. I panicked and sought help from my father, Dr Goh Seng Heng who lasered my skin everyday until my Acne subsided and skin improved.

				How did that lead to the business idea?

				PPP started by sheer coincidence at a time when I became an Acne patient myself. I experienced firsthand how laser and light technology worked and I was amazed with how fast the treatment was. Best of all, there was no downtime! This got me curious and I asked my father loads of questions about the science of selective photo-thermolysis and how lasers worked in the context of different skin problems. He showed me how he administered the Laser facial treatment using a particular protocol and technique that he developed since 1992.

				After talking to patients and friends, I came realise that many people could not afford medical laser facials due to its expensive price tag. People also had this stigma that Lasers were painful, inconvenient and had a significant period of downtime.

				This inspired me to develop a concept where medical doctors could administer fast and safe laser facials in a systematic and controlled way according to a treatment protocol developed by Dr Goh.

				<h3>So why did you call it PPP?</h3>

				I decided to call it PPP after the acronym Pores, Pimples and Pigmentation as that was the bulk of the skin conditions that our laser facials could treat. And I kinda liked the ring to the name- PPP!

				<h3>What makes PPP's medical laser facials different from others?</h3>

				(1) Its performed by medical doctors, who have been trained by Dr Goh Seng Heng, our chief medical preceptor.
				<br />(2) It has no downtime so patients can literally zap their faces right before they go out for a dinner date.
				<br />(3) Its really quick (less than 5 minutes) so thats great for busy people who don't have time 1 hour facials.

				<h3>What's your dream and vision for PPP?</h3>

				My mission is to make medical laser facials accessible, affordable and available for everyone around the world because I believe that everyone deserves access to clear glowing healthy skin!
