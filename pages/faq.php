							<p>PPP Laser Clinic operates on a walk-in, no appointment basis for the Laser Light Cleaning System (LLCS) treatment. Please check clinic opening and doctor hours on www.ppp.com.sg before proceeding to your preferred clinic. You may be required to make an appointment for our Combo treatment, as only select clinics have a Combo treatment machine. Ask our staff for help when booking your next Combo treatment. Appointment booking systems are available at our headquarters, Dr Goh Seng Heng and Partners, 290 Orchard Road Paragon Medical Tower (Lobby 2), Level 15-10/12.</p>

						<div class="panel-body faqtext">
							<p>Please understand that all patients are to wear eye goggles for their own protection. Direct exposure to a laser beam will cause eye damage. We have the right to refrain from performing treatment on you if you refuse to wear the safety eye goggles.</p>

							<p>If safety goggles are not worn, exposure to the laser beam can cause blindness (see above), hence following our strict safety protocol is imperative. Being fully aware of possible complications and inconveniences helps our patients understand why the PPP Treatment Protocol is designed as such. For more enquiries about specific complications and risks, speak to any PPP Doctor.</p>
